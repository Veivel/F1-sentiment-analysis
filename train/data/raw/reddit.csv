0,iioo0wh,"Hello everyone coming in from r/All! Allow me to offer a bit of context as to why this post has gained so much traction:

We have to start at the end of last week. Aston Martin F1 driver Sebastian Vettel, a 4-time World Champion, announced his retirement from the sport on Friday. During the weekend lots of drivers were floated in the media as his potential successor, but on Monday 2-time World Champion and current Alpine F1 driver Fernando Alonso announced he'd be moving to Aston Martin to fill that seat vacated by Vettel. This news was quite a shock to many because it was widely presumed that he would renew his contract with his current team for at least another year, with some sources even going as far as saying it was a done deal only waiting to be announced.

To many, the obvious choice to fill Alonso's current seat was Alpine F1 reserve driver Oscar Piastri. Piastri, having won back to back championships in Formula 3 and Formula 2, is widely perceived as one of the most exciting talents without an F1 seat. Alpine confirmed, as recently as today, that Piastri is under contract with them.

An hour or two ago Alpine finally sent out an announcement confirming Oscar Piastri's promotion to the race seat vacated by Alonso. However, rather than a happy tweet or Instagram post from Piastri celebrating his promotion, he stayed silent for about an hour before sending out the tweet this post is about. He categorically denies having signed a contract with Alpine, and also shuts the door on driving for Alpine in 2023. Piastri is presumed to have signed a pre-contract at McLaren, which on paper does not have a seat available for him at the moment.

And for those thinking ""I think I've seen this film before""... You're completely right. Over in INDYCAR (shoutout to our friends over at r/INDYCAR), they're currently in a similar situation with current Chip Ganassi Racing driver Alex Palou signing for McLaren, likely their INDYCAR team, despite (according to Chip Ganassi Racing) being contracted to drive for Ganassi in 2023.",1659469069.0,1,Blanchimont,0,1

At the same time, rumours were that two time champion Fernando Alonso was close to signing an extension with his current team, Alpine.

Yesterday Aston Martin dropped the bombshell that they signed Fernando Alonso. Today Alpine announced that junior driver and Formula 2 champion, Oscar Piastri, would make his debut and drive for them in 2023, taking over Alonso's vacant seat.

These last 5 days have truly been a wild ride for F1. 

Friday: Sebastian Vettel joins social media to the surprise of everyone, and announces his retirement from F1 at the end of the season. 

Saturday: Nicholas Latifi tops FP3 in his Williams before George Russell qualifies P1 for Mercedes with Verstappen's Red Bull languishing in P10, with Ferrari looking strong in P2 and 3.

Sunday: Verstappen wins from P10 on the grid, ten seconds ahead of P2, despite a sympathy spin towards the end of the race. Ferrari continue to decide that it's better to lose a race than it is to win one and kiss goodbye to Leclerc's WDC hopes with a race strategy using hard tyres that even a dim-witted monkey would realise is bad, resulting in Verstappen (probably) winning the championship this year regardless of what Ferrari do for the second half of the season.

Monday: Fernando Alonso takes Sebastian Vettel's place at Aston Martin from 2023 after signing a multi-year contract with the team, apparently without Alpine's Team Principle knowing and after talks rumoured to confirm Alonso will stay with Alpine for 2023.

Tuesday: Alpine announce Oscar Piastri for 2023. Ninety minutes later, Piastri himself releases a statement denying he is racing for Alpine and claims their statement was released without his knowledge.

Behind the scenes: Ricciardo intends to leave for Alpine and both parties already know this. Piastri does not intend to race for Alpine and Alpine already knew this was going to happen, and have been talking to Ricciardo, including Otmar who is just playing coy for legal reasons to the media.  


 Ricciardo states he intends to race for Mclaren, so that legally he can say he wanted to and was willing to race next year in McLaren so that they are forced to buy out his contract at full price in arbitration.  Equally, Alpine state that Piastri is driving for them so that then can force McLaren to buy him out as well, as to not lose him for nothing. If it appears that they did not fully intend of giving him a race seat, he can walk on his contract and heads at Alpine will have to roll.  Piastri confirms this is the plan by stating he will not drive for them next year, there by 'forcing' alpine to let McLaren buy him out, which they will have to do because they demonstrated their intent to give him a drive.  


In the end the way these things always work is that you CANNOT physically force someone to get into your car and perform if they do not want to, and the right business move is to get something out of the situation and move on.
